## Introduction

Smart Share is a dynamic, peer-to-peer, full torrent client built upon libtorrent and designed with the purpose of making the sharing of large files accessible to everyone without the need for third-party applications. At its core, it's an experience aiming to redefine the way you share and interact with files in the digital space.

## Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Torrenting**: Leverage the power of decentralized sharing with our full torrent client, focusing on efficiency and scalability.

- **Unique .smartshare Files**: Easily create .smartshare files that make it possible for only the receiver to initiate downloading from the creator, enhancing privacy and control over shared content.

- **Utilizes Kademlia Network**: Smart Share makes efficient use of the Kademlia decentralized network, ensuring fast and reliable file sharing.

- **Easy to Use & Configurable**: With a simple drag and drop interface, sharing files has never been easier. Smart Share is also customizable, allowing you to adjust settings and alter the UI for a personalized touch through a YAML configuration file.

## Libtorrent 

Libtorrent is a feature-complete C++ BitTorrent implementation focusing on efficiency and scalability. It's capable of running on both embedded devices and desktops. Its well-documented library interface is easy to use and even comes with a simple BitTorrent client demonstrating the library's use.

The main goals of libtorrent are to be CPU efficient, memory efficient, and very easy to use. For more information, visit [Libtorrent](https://www.libtorrent.org/).

## Kademlia 

Kademlia is a distributed hash table for decentralized peer-to-peer computer networks. It dictates the structure of the network and the exchange of information through node lookups, thereby increasing resistance against denial-of-service attacks.
